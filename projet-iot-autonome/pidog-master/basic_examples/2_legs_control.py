''' legs control
    Basic use of leg servos control

API:
    Pidog.legs_move(target_angles, immediately=True, speed=50)

        legs servo angles control, it will store the target_angles in a buffer, and the built-in leg servo control thread will control the angle of the servos

        - target_angles   n*8 2D list, angle arrangements of leg servos, could be one group of angles,
                          or multiple groups of angles, the order of the servos is:
                          [[ left front leg, left front leg, right front leg, right front leg,
                              left hind leg, left hind leg,right hind leg, right hind leg],
                          [...], ...]

        - immediately    bool, whether to execute the specified action immediately, if true: it will clear the buffer first, and store the target_angles,
                         the set actions will be executed immediately; if false, the will add target_angles at the end of the buffer, the actions will be
                         executed after previous actions have been executed

        - speed    int, speed of action, 0 ~ 100

    Pidog.is_legs_done()
        whether all the actions of leg in the buffer to be executed

    Pidog.wait_legs_done()
        wait for all the actions of leg in the buffer to be executed

    Pidog.legs_stop()
        clear all the actions of leg in the buffer, to make legs stop
